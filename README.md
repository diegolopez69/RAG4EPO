# RAG4EPO
This repository contains code for a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system applied to the European Patent Office (EPO) for the  pharmaceutical enterprise SANDOZ. It includes notebooks covering the entire process from web scraping to fine-tuning the model. This project is part of my Master's Thesis in Artificial Intelligence.
